These files were taken from the following data set:

For the current project, the files mentioned above were processed in the 
program "run_analysis.R" [R version 3.1.1 (2014-07-10) -- "Sock it to Me"].

The data set produced by the program is "data_set_mean_values.txt", and
it contains mean values calculated from select raw measurements.

The values contained in the text file are of kinematic measurements taken 
from volunteers while they engaged in various physical activities.
